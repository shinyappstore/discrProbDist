# discrProbDist: Explore Discrete Probability Distribution by MEPHAS

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/discrProbDist](https://shinyappstore.com/a/discrProbDist)__

discrProbDist stands is a shiny application within the MEPHAS suite, dedicated to the comprehensive exploration and analysis of Binomial and Poisson Distributions. Tailored for user-friendly statistical methodologies, discrProbDist offers an interactive interface with distinct tabs for analyzing various distributions. discrProbDist  allows the user to get a plot of Binomial Distribution B(n,p); n is the total sample size, p is the probability of success / event from the total sample; np=mean, np(1-p)=variance; To get the probability of a certain position (at the red point). For poisson distribution - the app allows the user to draw a plot of Poisson Distribution P(Rate); Rate indicates the expected number of occurrences; Rate = mean =variance; to get the probability of a certain position (at the red point).
